ggasym (pronounced "gg-awesome") plots a symmetric matrix with two different fill aesthetics for the top-left and bottom-right triangles and along the diagonal. It operates within the Grammar of Graphics paradigm implemented in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

## Download and Installation

You can download and install from the GitHub repo. Eventually, this will hopefully be available on CRAN, too.

```{r devtools_download, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jhrcook/ggasym")
```

And load the package with the standard `library` function.

```{r load_lib}
library(ggasym)
```

## Basic Usage

Here is a basic example. `tib` is a "tibble" (ie. fancy "data.frame") of comparisons between groups "A" through "E". There are two values to be plotted, `val_1` and `val_2`, that hold data on the comparison between `g1` and `g2`. `tib` is first passed to `asymmetrise` to fill in all the missing combinations between `g1` and `g2` such that the symmetric matrix can be built. All added values take the value `NA`. The modified data table is finally passed to `ggplot` and `geom_asymmat` is added on. Here, `asymmetrise` added the rows where `g1` and `g2` are equal, thus will fill the diagonal. I set these values to `val_3`.

```{r example1}
tib <- tibble(g1 = c("A", "A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "D"),
              g2 = c("B", "C", "D", "E", "C", "D", "E", "D", "E", "E"),
              val_1 = seq(1, 10, 1),
              val_2 = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 3))
tib <- asymmetrise(tib, g1, g2)
tib$val_3 <- runif(nrow(tib))
ggplot(tib, aes(x = g1, y = g2)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = val_1, fill_br = val_2, fill_diag = val_3)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_gradient(low = "lightblue1", high = "dodgerblue") +
    scale_fill_diag_gradient(low = "yellow", high = "orange3")
```

## New Aesthetics

The new aesthetics `fill_tl`, `fill_br`, and `fill_diag` behave just like the normal `fill`, except that they correspond to the top-left ("tl") and bottom-right ("br") triangles of the matrix, respectively. This package also includes analogous functions for scaling the fill colors such as `scale_fill_tl_gradient2` and `scale_fill_br_gradientn` that operate just as expected when using ggplot2.

```{r example2}
ggplot(tib, aes(x = g1, y = g2)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = val_1, fill_br = val_2, fill_diag = val_3)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_gradient2(low = "orange", mid = "white", high = "dodgerblue") +
    scale_fill_diag_gradientn(colors = rainbow(25))
```

### Adjusting Colorbars

Of note, with three colorbars, it may be useful to control their position and other properties. This can be done just like normal in ggplot by passing the correct values to the `guide` parameter in `scale_fill_*_gradient` ([original documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guide_colourbar.html)). Below are a few of the options where I put the bars horizontal, adjust the ordering, and put the title above each.

```{r adj_colorbars}
ggplot(tib, aes(x = g1, y = g2)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = val_1, fill_br = val_2, fill_diag = val_3)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 1,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_br_gradient2(low = "orange", mid = "white", high = "dodgerblue",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 3,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_diag_gradientn(colors = rainbow(25),
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 2,
                                                   title.position = "top"))
```

## Full ggplot2 integration

Since the new geom is a normal ggplot2 object, it can be introduced into a standard ggplot2 workflow. Note that the labels can be adjusted like normal using the `labs` function and using the `fill_tl`, `fill_br`, and `fill_diag` arguments.

```{r example3}
ggplot(tib, aes(x = g1, y = g2)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = log(val_1),
                     fill_br = val_2,
                     fill_diag = val_3)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 1,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_br_gradient(low = "lightblue1", high = "dodgerblue",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 3,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_diag_gradient(low = "grey80", high = "grey20",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 2,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    labs(fill_tl = "top-left fill",
         fill_br = "bottom-right fill",
         fill_diag = "diagonal fill",
         title = "Example of ggasym") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey70"),
          panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0))
```


## Facetting

If you have multiple categories, facetting works as expected. The only difference is in the preparation of the data table: you must `group_by` the value(s) you will facet by before passing to `asymmetrise`. This is shown below.

```{r facetting_setup}
tib <- tibble(g1 = rep(c("A", "A", "B"), 2),
              g2 = rep(c("B", "C", "C"), 2),
              val_1 = seq(1, 6),
              val_2 = rnorm(6),
              grps = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2))
tib
```

Grouping first by `grps`, the tibble is asymmetrized while retaining the `grps` assignments. I then added values to the diagonal.

```{r grouped_asymm}
tib <- tib %>% group_by(grps) %>% asymmetrise(g1, g2) %>% ungroup()
tib <- tib %>% mutate(val_3 = ifelse(g1 == g2, runif(nrow(tib)), NA))
tib
```

```{r facetting_plot}
ggplot(tib, aes(x = g1, y = g2)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = log(val_1),
                     fill_br = val_2,
                     fill_diag = val_3)) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient(low = "lightpink", high = "tomato",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 1,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_br_gradient(low = "lightblue1", high = "dodgerblue",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 3,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    scale_fill_diag_gradient(low = "grey80", high = "grey20",
                           guide = guide_colourbar(direction = "horizontal",
                                                   order = 2,
                                                   title.position = "top")) +
    labs(fill_tl = "top-left fill",
         fill_br = "bottom-right fill",
         fill_diag = "diagonal fill",
         title = "Example of facetting with ggasym") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey70"),
          panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    facet_grid(. ~ grps)
```

## Statistical Test Wrapper

I created a wrapper for handling the results of a statistical test to produce a tibble ready to be plotted with ggasym. Here is a brief example - a more detailed example is shown in the vignette ["Statistical Test Plotting"](https://jhrcook.github.io/ggasym/articles/ggasym-stats.html). Here I test if the median sale price of houses in Austin, Texas is different between any of the years (for more information on the data source: `?ggplot2::txhousing`).

```{r stats_example_prep}
tib <- ggplot2::txhousing %>%
    filter(city == "Austin") %>%
    mutate(year = as.character(year))
aov_res <- aov(median ~ year, data = tib)
broom::tidy(aov_res)
```

Before plotting, the results of the Tukey post-hoc test are passed to `asymmetrise_stats` that prepares the data for `geom_asymmat`. The resulting tibble is then plotted and styled in ggplot2.

```{r stats_example_plot}
asymmat_tib <- asymmetrise_stats(TukeyHSD(aov_res))
ggplot(asymmat_tib, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
    geom_asymmat(aes(fill_tl = estimate,
                     fill_br = -log10(adj.p.value + 0.0000001))) +
    scale_fill_tl_gradient2(low = "dodgerblue", high = "tomato") +
    scale_fill_br_distiller(type = "seq", palette = "Greens", direction = 1) +
    labs(title = "Median House Prices in Austin",
         fill_tl = "diff. in\nmean values",
         fill_br = "-log10( adj. p-value )") +
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey75"),
          panel.grid = element_blank()) +
    scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0))
```
